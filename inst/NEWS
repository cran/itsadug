# itsadug 2.1

## Major changes:

The package 'itsadug' has been split into two: all general multipurpose plot functions have been moved to the new package 'plotfunctions', whereas 'itsadug' now contains only the functions specialized for (nonlinear) regression models and autocorrelation problems.

## Bug fixes:

- fixed mark.diff error for nonsignificant differences
- fixed bug in plot_smooth: using 'fit' as predictor will cause an 
  interpretable error message instead of not plotting
- fixed bug in plot_smooth: lty and lwd can be set for the different levels of 
  plot_all.
- fixed bug in plot_modelfit: can also be used for binomial count data 
  (only with logit link)


## Other:
- by installing the package data.table, start_event will run much faster

# itsadug 2.0

## Major changes:

### a. Vignettes:
New vignettes. Setup as short tutorials, which also introduce useful functions. Currently three included, about inspection of the model, testing for significance, and checking for autocorrelation. See also help(itsadug) for an overview.

### a. New functions:
- plot_modelfit: plotting the model fit and data for n randomly selected time series
- plot_data (thanks to Tino Sering): plot observations on which model is based
- check_resid newly implemented: check distribution of residuals and autocorrelation
- diagnostics: inspect trends in residuals and distributions of predictors
- plot_image: add image to plot region or as background
- get_pca_predictions: extract the effect of a predictor that was included as part of a principle component
- plot_pca_surface: plot surface of a principle component predictors in GAMMs
- get_fitted: return fitted values, with or with random effects
- wald_gam: nonparametric test for categorical predictors
- start_value_rho: determine a start value for rho, which need to be finetuned
- derive_timeseries: derive time series from AR.start info in the model
- marginDensityPlot: add distribution of predictor in the margins of a plot

### b. Bugs fixed:
- fixed bug in acf_resid: errors that appeared with missing data should be fixed
- fixed bug in fvisgam: too.far reimplemented
- fixed bug in plot_smooth: with col=NULL no line was plotted, now with col=NULL a black line is plotted
- fixed bug in check_normaldist: now it also works with binomial distribution (automatically centered)

### Minor changes:

### a. New utility functions:
getRange, getDec, list2str, rug.model, getProps, drawArrows, add_bars

### b. New functionality / arguments of existing functions

- plot_smooth, fvisgam, plot_diff, plot_diff2: 
	* argument transform.view added for transforming values on x- and / or y axis
- get_predictions, get_difference, get_fitted, plot_smooth: rm.ranef behavior changed. 
	* Instead of logic values, also vector with modelterm numbers could be specified to cancel.
- acf_resid, check_resid: argument split_pred allows to automatically derive events based on AR.start input
- plot_diff, argument mark.diff: by default differences are marked and printed to output
- gradientLegend, argument dec: possibility to round legend values
	* influences fvisgam, pvisgam, plot_diff2, plotsurface: allow for nicer decimal rounding of legend with argument dec
- gradientLegend, argument pos.num: possibility to change the position of the numbers
- compareML:
	* argument print.output: option to store output and suppress the printing
	* argument signif.stars: option to suppress significance stars
- gamtabs: possibility to specify summary of model instead of model
- start_event: 	data.table functions (optional) for speeding up start_event
- acf_n_plots: argument print.summary to suppress output text
- errorBars, argument se2: possibility to plot asymmetric errors
- errorBars, argument horiz: possibility to plot horizontal errors
